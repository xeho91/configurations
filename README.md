## üì¶ Packages

The following packages are available under the [packages/](./packages)
directory. Each of them has its own instructions _(in the `README.md` files)_
on how to use them.

All of them are [scoped], so they are prefixed with `@xeho91/`.
My packages from this project are accessible for public use and downloandable
from the [npmjs] registry.

üìù **NOTE**: I encourage you to create your own configuration(s). There's no
universal one, and I don't want to enforce anything. You are free to use my
project as inspiration. If you had a better idea how to organize them, would
you please mind sharing? Thank you!
