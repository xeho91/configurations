## üìî Coding style guidelines

1. **Please don't write short syntax and abbreviations**.\
   Make the code easy to read, understandable, and very communicative, even if
   that will be more verbose and take more time/effort to write. Put yourself
   in the shoes of other contributors, especially when they just began their
   journey as a developer.

    - **It also regards to file(s) and directory(ies) naming!**

1. **Write functions with declarative names** _(non-anonymous)_.\
   If your function is complex, then instead of arrow functions _(unless you
   need to use lexical `this` or have other good reason)_, declare it as
   a standard function with a descriptive name.

1. **Try to follow the good practices of the JavaScript naming conventions.**\
   Credits to [the article about the naming convention best practices].

    - **Constants** - Capital letters _(UPPERCASE)_

    ```js
    const SECONDS = 60;
    const MINUTES = 60;
    const HOURS = 24;
    const DAY = SECONDS * MINUTES * HOURS;
    ```

    - **Variable** - camelCase

    ```js
    const firstName = "Matt";
    ```

    - **Boolean** - camelCase and with one of the following prefix: `is`,
      `are`, `has`

    ```js
    const isVisible = true;
    const areEqual = false;
    const hasEncryption = true;
    ```

    - **Function** - camelCase

    ```js
    function getName(firstName, lastName) {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
    }
    ```

    - **Class** - PascalCase

    ```js
    class SoftwareDeveloper {
        constructor(firstName, lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }
    }
    ```

    - **Methods** - camelCase

    ```js
     class SoftwareDeveloper {
         getName() {
             return ( ... );
         };
     }
    ```

    - **Private** - camelCase and with an underscore (`_`) prefix

    ```js
     class SoftwareDeveloper {
         constructor(firstName, lastName) {
             this.name = _getName(firstName, lastName);
         }

         _getName(firstName, lastName) {
             return `${firstName ${lastName}`;
         }
     }
    ```

    - **Components** _(in any framework)_ - PascalCase

    ```js
     const UserProfile = (props) {
         return ( ... );
     }
    ```

1. **Make your commit messages descriptive and ordered.**\
   Don't be afraid to edit the commit history during the Pull Request.
   Please ensure it's explaining pretty straightforward with what's going on
   and the changes it relates to.

    - It is preferable to see changes be split into small commits, so they
      explain step by step. Quantity is not essential, but the quality of
      communication and educating/informing contributors will help a lot.

1. **Organize imported modules in the code.**\
   This way, we can visually see which modules are ours from this project and
   which one has been imported from `node_modules` or Node.js packages /
   built-in modules.

## üë£ Developing steps

1. **Create a new branch - off from the `develop` branch** for your work with
   the following git command:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b feature/#<short_name>
    ```

    where you replace the tag `#<short_name>` with the name of the feature, or
    with a unique id if you use any advanced Git flow integrations _(e.g.
    [Jira] or [GitHub])_.

1. **Code your modifications/new features**, and commit them along the way.
   Please read more about set [Git commits
   convention](#git-commits-convention), and [writing commit
   messages](writing-commit-messages).

1. **Analyze** _(use linters)_ **the changes using available commands**, such
   as:

   ```sh
   pnpm lint
   ```

   Read more about this script in the [`pnpm lint`](#pnpm-lint) section.

1. When your changes are ready, **push the branch to a remote repo** with the
   following git command:

    ```sh
    git push origin feature/#<short_name>
    ```

1. **Merge it to `develop` branch**, whenever you decide during your process.

1. Lastly, **merge it to the production branch - `main`**, when you are sure that
   your code is ready and has no bugs. Writing tests helps to build confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Git setup

This section explains the configured Git flow for this project.

### Git commits convention

[![Conventional Commits shield]][Conventional Commits] [![Gitmoji shield]][Gitmoji]

**This project uses [Conventional Commits], and [Gitmoji] commits
conventions.**

[Conventional Commits shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg?style=for-the-badge
[Conventional Commits]: https://conventionalcommits.org "Conventional commits convention"

[Gitmoji shield]: https://img.shields.io/badge/gitmoji-%20üòú%20üòç-FFDD67.svg?style=for-the-badge
[Gitmoji]: https://gitmoji.dev "Gitmoji convention"

### Writing commit messages

The currently recommended CLI _(Command Line Interface)_ tool to use them both
is the [gacp] Node.js package. The local config for this tool is set in the
[`.gacprc.js`](./.gacprc.js) file.

**You can either use:**

```sh
pnpm commit
```

**or install [gacp] globally on your device.**

More information about this script is in the [pnpm commit](#pnpm-commit)
section.

[gacp]: https://github.com/vivaxy/gacp

### Git hooks

There are Git hooks configured with the [Husky] tool.\
They should be installed automatically during the `pnpm install` process. In
case they didn't, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm prepare
```

Existing hooks:

- **pre-commit** - will analyze all of staged file _(code)_ changes with the
  [`pnpm lint:staged`](#pnpm-lintstaged) script.
- **commit-msg** - will ensure the provided commit message follows the set [Git
  commits convention](#git-commits-convention).

## üß∞ Scripts

üëâ **REMINDER:** This project uses [`pnpm`] as [Node.js] package manager.

[`pnpm`]: https://pnpm.io/
[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/en/

The following scripts are available for this project:

- [`pnpm build`](#pnpm-build)
- [`pnpm commit`](#pnpm-commit)
- [`pnpm lint`](#pnpm-lint)
  - [`pnpm lint:commits`](#pnpm-lintcommits)
  - [`pnpm lint:js`](#pnpm-lintjs)
  - [`pnpm lint:ls`](#pnpm-lintls)
  - [`pnpm lint:staged`](#pnpm-lintstaged)
  - [`pnpm lint:ts`](#pnpm-lintts)
- [`pnpm prepare`](#pnpm-prepare)

### `pnpm build`

**Builds the output for the production** into [`dist/`](./dist) directory using
[TypeScript].\

The [TypeScript] configuration is in the [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json) file.

[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/

### `pnpm commit`

**Runs a commit message generator for the staged files** using the [gacp]
Node.js package.

The [gacp] configuration is in the [.gacprc.js](./.gacprc.js) file.

### `pnpm lint`

**Runs all of the set linting scripts in parallel**.\
It uses the [npm-run-all] Node.js package.

[npm-run-all]: https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all

#### `pnpm lint:commits`

**Analyzes the latest commit messages from the develop branch to latest**, in
order to adhere to set commit convention with [commitlint].

The [commitlint] configuration is in the [.commitlintrc.js](./.commitlintrc.js)
file.

[commitlint]: https://commitlint.js.org/#/

#### `pnpm lint:js`

Statically **analyzes the [JavaScript]/[TypeScript] source code** with
[ESLint] to quickly find problems.\

The [ESLint] configuration is in the [.eslintrc.js](./.eslintrc.js) file.

[JavaScript]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript
[ESLint]: https://eslint.org/

#### `pnpm lint:ls`

**Checks the file names** in the project based on their parent folder and file
extension with [ls-lint].

The [ls-lint] configuration is in the [.ls-lint.yml](./.ls-lint.yml) file.

[ls-lint]: https://ls-lint.org/

#### `pnpm lint:staged`

**Runs the linters on the files in the Git staging area** with a [lint-staged]
Node.js package.

The [lint-staged] configuration is in the
[.lintstagedrc.js](./.lintstagedrc.js) file.

[lint-staged]: https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged

#### `pnpm lint:ts`

**Starts type checking all kinds of JavaScript code files** with [TypeScript]
compiler.

The [TypeScript] configuration is in the [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json) file.

### `pnpm prepare`

**Installs the Git hooks** with [Husky]. Should be run only once, when cloning
the project and developing.

This script should run automatically only once - during the `pnpm install`.
After that, there's no need to use it.

The [Husky] hooks are configured in the [.husky/](./.husky) directory.
